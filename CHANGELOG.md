## [0.5.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/ventriloquist/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) (Apr 06, 2014)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY:

  - Support for Vagrant < 1.5 has been removed, please try to use a previous plugin
    version if you can't upgrade.
  - Services / platforms versions are now required to be specified from Vagrantfile
    to increase reproducibility / reduce the chances of surprises and simplify plugin
    maintenance.
  - _All_ of the services images have been rebuilt from scratch and are now
    trusted builds.
  - The base image for services was changed from Ubuntu Quantal 12.10 to Debian Jessie.

FEATURES:

  - Added shortcut for installing multiple ruby / nodejs / python versions from `Vagrantfile`

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - core: Bumped docker to 0.9.1
  - core: Removed dependency on [vocker]
  - core: Simplified usage with vagrant-lxc
  - platforms: Improved handling of multiple versions specifications
  - platforms: Show message when already installed instead of keeping silent
  - platforms/phantomjs: Leverage vagrant-cachier on installation
  - platforms/phantomjs: Fix installation of recent versions
  - platforms/go: Leverage vagrant-cachier on installation
  - platforms/elixir: Fix installation of recent versions
  - services/postgres: Rename ventriloquist-pg images to ventriloquist-postgres


## [0.4.1](https://github.com/fgrehm/ventriloquist/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) (December 13, 2013)

BUG FIXES:

  - Bump [[vocker]] to 0.4.1 and fix check for whether services are running [[GH-39]]

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/ventriloquist/compare/v0.3.2...v0.4.0) (December 3, 2013)

FEATURES:

  - Added support for RethinkDB [[GH-4]]
  - Support for installing guest specific packages (aka `apt-get install`)
  - Introduce `:type` and `:vimage` parameters for services allowing us to provision
    multiple containers of the same kind with less pain.
  - Docker containers are now named after the services configured on the Vagrantfile

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY:

  - _All_ of the services images have been rebuilt from scratch. The reason behind
    it is that we inlined `RUN` instructions in order to reduce the amount of AUFS
    layers and disk space taken by images.
  - From now on we'll lock Docker installation to a "known to work version"
    by default (currently 0.7.0). Things are moving pretty fast over there and it
    is pretty hard to keep up with all the changes and to ensure things are
    running smooth. You can still specify the version on your `Vagrantfile` but
    by default it will be a specific version.
  - The Docker images that make up for services no longer exposes host ports by
    default in order to aling with Docker's [recent changes](http://blog.docker.io/2013/10/docker-0-6-5-links-container-naming-advanced-port-redirects-host-integration)
    related to the way exposed ports work.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - core: Bumped [vocker] dependency to 0.4.0
  - core: Provide feedback during provisioning whether a service is already running
  - platforms/go: Bumped to 1.2
  - platforms/elixir: Bumped to 0.11.2 [[GH-34]]
  - platforms/phantomjs: Bumped to 1.9.2
  - platforms/rvm: Install globally [[GH-24]]
  - services: Most images had the `RUN` instructions inlined in order to reduce the amount
    of AUFS layers
  - services/elasticsearch: Bumped to 0.90.7
  - services/memcached: Bumped to 1.4.15
  - services/redis: Bumped to 2.8.2
  - services/mysql: Support for 5.6
  - services/postgresql: Support for 9.3
  - services/postgresql: Make use of packages from http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt
    instead of the deprecated `ppa:pitti/postgresql`
